This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications where native modules are accessed before they are fully loaded.  The `BuggyNativeModule.js` file showcases the incorrect approach, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `FixedNativeModule.js` file presents the correct approach using promises or async/await to ensure the module is ready before use. This problem is particularly relevant when dealing with complex native modules or modules that have a longer initialization time.
